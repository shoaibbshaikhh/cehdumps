            question: "As a cybersecurity professional, you are responsible for securing a high-traffic web application that uses MySQL as its backend database. Recently, there has been a surge of unauthorized login attempts, and you suspect that a seasoned black-hat hacker is behind them. This hacker has shown proficiency in SQL Injection and appears to be using the 'UNION' SQL keyword to trick the login process into returning additional data. However, your application's security measures include filtering special characters in user inputs, a method usually effective against such attacks. In this challenging environment, if the hacker still intends to exploit this SQL Injection vulnerability, which strategy is he most likely to employ?",
            options: ["The hacker tries to manipulate the 'UNION' keyword in such a way that it triggers a database error potentially revealing valuable information about the database's structure", "The hacker alters his approach and injects a 'DROP TABLE' statement, a move that could potentially lead to the loss of vital data stored in the application's database", "The hacker attempts to bypass the special character filter by encoding his malicious input, which could potentially enable him to successfully inject damaging SQL queries", "The hacker switches tactics and resorts to a 'time-based blind' SQL Injection attack, which would force the application to delay its response, thereby revealing information based on the duration of the delay"],
            answer: "C. The hacker attempts to bypass the special character filter by encoding his malicious input, which could potentially enable him to successfully inject damaging SQL queries"

            question: "As an IT Security Analyst, you've been asked to review the security measures of an e-commerce website that relies on a SQL database for storing sensitive customer data. Recently, an anonymous tip has alerted you to a possible threat: a seasoned hacker who specializes in SQL Injection attacks may be targeting your system. The site already employs input validation measures to prevent basic injection attacks, and it blocks any user inputs containing suspicious patterns. However, this hacker is known to use advanced SQL Injection techniques. Given this situation, which of the following strategies would the hacker most likely adopt to bypass your security measures?",
            options: ["The hacker could deploy an 'out-of-band' SQL Injection attack, extracting data via a different communication channel, such as DNS or HTTP requests", "The hacker may try to use SQL commands which are less known and less likely to be blocked by your system's security", "The hacker might employ a 'blind' SQL Injection attack, taking advantage of the application's true or false responses to extract data bit by bit", "The hacker may resort to a DDoS attack instead, attempting to crash the server and thus render the e-commerce site unavailable"],

The system uses RSA encryption with key sizes of 'n' bits for securing transaction data. The key generation process involves finding two large primes 'p' and 'q', such that 'n=p*q'. Given 'p=150' and 'q=200', the security level is deemed to be sufficient for current threats. The system can handle a decryption process with a time complexity of O(n^1.5) without compromising performance. However, an attacker using Shor's algorithm on a quantum computer could potentially crack RSA with a time complexity of O(log n)^3. Assuming 'n=30000' and variables 'p' and 'q', which scenario will likely maximize the decryption time 'T' for the attacker?",
            options: ["p=140, q=210: Here, 'p' decreases while 'q' increases, which could lead to a decrease in 'n', and thus a reduced complexity for the attacker.", "p=175, q=250: The key size 'n' is adjusted by increasing both 'p and 'q', thereby increasing the complexity of the attacker's decryption process.", "p=160, q=240: A modest increase in both 'p' and 'q' results in a larger key size 'n', increasing the complexity for the attacker.", "p=130, q=230: By decreasing 'p' and increasing 'q', the key size 'n' decreases, reducing the complexity for the attacker."],

            question: "A sophisticated attacker targets your web server with the intent to execute a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. His strategy involves a unique mixture of TCP SYN, UDP, and ICMP floods, using 'r' packets per second. Your server, reinforced with advanced security measures, can handle 'h' packets per second before it starts showing signs of strain. If 'r' surpasses 'h', it overwhelms the server, causing it to become unresponsive. In a peculiar pattern, the attacker selects 'r' as a composite number and 'h' as a prime number, making the attack detection more challenging. Considering 'r=2010' and different values for 'h, which of the following scenarios would potentially cause the server to falter?",
            options: ["h=1999 (prime): Despite the attacker's packet flood, the server can handle these requests, remaining responsive", "h=1993 (prime): Despite being less than 'r', the server's prime number capacity keeps it barely operational, but the risk of falling is imminent", "h=1987 {prime): The attacker's packet rate exceeds the server's capacity, causing potential unresponsiveness", "h=2003 {prime): The server can manage more packets than the attacker is sending, hence it stays operational"],
